# Restaurant Recommendation

#### Project topic:

For this project, I built the recommender system that allows users to upload the restaurant file and business file for analysis and make recommendations based on the restaurant they are interested in. The analyzing algorithm primarily focuses on the text reviews analysis through TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency).  And from the website the user could filter the city and number of recommendations based on their own choices.
